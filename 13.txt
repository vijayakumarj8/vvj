13. Write a program to compare two numbers in 8051 using simulator.



; Compare two numbers in 8051

ORG 0000H

MOV A, #0x05 ; Move 05h into accumulator
MOV B, #0x03 ; Move 03h into register B

; Compare A and B
CMP A, B

; Jump to label if A is greater than B
JNC LABEL1

; Jump to label if A is less than B
JC LABEL2

; If A is equal to B, continue execution

LABEL1:
MOV A, #0x01 ; Move 01h into accumulator if A is greater than B
SJMP END

LABEL2:
MOV A, #0x02 ; Move 02h into accumulator if A is less than B
SJMP END

END:
NOP ; No operation









output:
After running the program, the accumulator (A) should contain 01H.
